Source of truth for process: `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` §67, §78 (`System_Prompt/Part4.md`, `Part5.md`). Ideas outside current scope go here instead of interrupting active work.

## Entries

### OAuth social login
Description: Add Google/GitHub/etc. providers to the Auth.js `Credentials` setup already in place.
Reason: Out of scope for Phase 1 MVP; the auth module and Auth.js config are structured so this is additive config, not a redesign (per `adr/0005`).
Priority: Medium.
Potential dependencies: None blocking.
Estimated value: Reduces registration friction.

### Email verification
Description: Verify a user's email address after registration before granting full access.
Reason: Requires a `notifications`/email-sending service not yet built; deferred out of Phase 1 MVP.
Priority: Medium.
Potential dependencies: A notifications service (SMTP/provider integration).
Estimated value: Reduces fake-account risk.

### Password reset ("forgot password")
Description: Let a user reset a forgotten password via an emailed link/token.
Reason: Same email-delivery dependency as email verification; deferred out of Phase 1 MVP.
Priority: High (before real users onboard).
Potential dependencies: A notifications service (SMTP/provider integration).
Estimated value: Table-stakes account-recovery flow.

### Dependency upgrade: Nest 11 / Next 16
Description: `npm audit` (2026-07-17) flags advisories in the NestJS 10.x/Express chain and Next.js 14.x that only clear via a major-version bump.
Reason: Deliberately not force-upgraded mid-Phase-1 to avoid pulling in untested majors without dedicated regression testing. See [20-known-issues.md](20-known-issues.md), [21-decision-log.md](21-decision-log.md).
Priority: Medium — no active exploit path identified for this app's usage, but should not sit indefinitely.
Potential dependencies: None blocking; standalone upgrade task.
Estimated value: Clears known CVEs, keeps the stack current.
